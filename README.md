# restaurant-page

This is a project to practice using webpack to bundle various sources.
The project is a bare bones restaurant homepage design, with tab switching.
The html and css is split into multiple files for easier maintainability and
modularity, with a simple webpack setup to bundle it all together into an
output dist folder that can be deployed on gh-pages.
